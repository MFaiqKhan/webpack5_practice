# Practicing Webpack 5

### All the file's contain comments for better understanding

pretty much the same as other module bundlers, which bundles your files
although some of them are fast or have slight changes like parcel, rollup, snowpack etc.

but they act the sameway, means they all perform the same work under the hood.

It's an evironment to setup and run the project in.

### Folders : 
```
src # where your srouce code goes (js, ts, jsx, tsx, etc)
dist # where your bundled code goes, all are static files are build into it.
    ## dist folder will have index.html, will be automatically generated by webpack plugin 
    ## plus live server plugin by webpack
``` 

### Creating modules and Webpack install and building:
_we can add type module in package.json to make it a module_
    **but** 
_webpack will take care of that for us__
```
npm init -y  // this will create a package.json file for us
npm install webpack --save-dev // this will install webpack in our project
npm install webpack-cli --save-dev // this will install webpack-cli in our project
```
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65840681/when-does-webpack-cli-comes-into-play)

add the following to package.json: under script tag when webpack.config.js in not initialized
```
"build": "webpack --mode production" // this is the default command when you run npm run build
```

will have to run npm run build on every change to generate main.js in the dist folder and also include the main.js in the index.html file in script tag.

we can also npm modules by installing and use them and it will be compiled by webpack in main.js

### Webpack config file:
make a webpack.config.js file in the root folder of the project
will use common js module syntax

```
module.exports = {
    mode: "production", // this is the default mode, but we can change it to development or production
    entry: "./src/index.js", // this is the default entry point, but we can change it to another file
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"), // this is the default output path, but we can change it to another path
        filename: "bundle.js" // this is the default output file name, but we can change it to another file name
    }
}
```
after that we can delete the --mode production and remain webpack in package.json under script tag
